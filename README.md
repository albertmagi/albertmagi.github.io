The target of this website is to someone who wants to contract a software engineer(it's a ficticius Curriculum Vitae). 

We have 5 important blocks on the website, first of all the menu on the top and the title with a picture of me and a picture about coding. Secondly we have the other block, that there's who I am and my working experience. 
The 3rd block it's about my skills(the programming languages I know) and next to it the languages I speak. 
The 4th it's about my education and the last one about how can you contact me and where you can find me. 

On the style of this website I used different tones of blue combined with white and grey. In my opinion these colors combine well. 

Thank you for visiting my website and I hope you like it.
